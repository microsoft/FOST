# FOST

<!-- FOST is an easy-use forecasting tools aiming at spatial-temporal forecasting. -->
FOST(Forecasting open source tool) aims to provide an easy-use tool for spatial-temporal forecasting. The users only need to organize their data into a certain format and then get the prediction results with one command. FOST automatically handles the missing and abnormal values, and captures both spatial and temporal correlations efficiently.

# Framework of FOST

Following is the framework of FOST, basically it contains 4 main components:

![FOST framework](https://dsm01pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mqv6c15r0vEfpNGcpMnUa4sOxYZFDDBL6h47EdLlVuKZcGTUw8LKrseJnZ2Q8hlJK3VB0lj13TJmF5pvrC5LeiKHR4cfSIGJT3YmV2D_-O6HpG8VFVKM5Alx9hEhAvc0fOAXFkthsC5qAccx8_eJsoKj8eTHvAns0z72v811JOVbswqGLWOeGNyUIjgQiL52F?width=1050&height=268&cropmode=none)

| Module name   | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Preprocessing | Preprocessing module aims to handle various data situation, currently FOST designed sub-module handles issues such as missing value, unalignment timestamp and feature selection. |
| Modeling      | FOST contains implements for different mainstream deep learning models such as RNN, MLP and GNN, for better performance on various custom data. Further model implements such as Transformer, N-beats are in progress. |
| Fusion        | Fusion module aims at automatically select and ensemble model predictions. |
| Utils         | There are many other utils in FOST, such as neural-network trainer and predictor, result plotter and so on. |

# Quick Start

## Installation

### Installation of dependency packages

#### 1. Prerequisites

This project relies on `pytorch >= 1.8` and `torch-geometric >= 1.7.2`

- torch installation reference linkï¼šhttps://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/

- torch-geometric installation reference link: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html

#### 2. Installation

You can install fost with pip:

```
pip install fostool
```

## Train with FOST

#### 1. Import forecasting pipeline

```python
from fostool.pipeline import Pipeline
```

#### 2. Setting data path and lookahead

You need to pass your `train.csv` and `graph.csv` for model training, see [dataformat](#data-format) for data preparing.

```python
train_path = '/path/to/your/train.csv'
graph_path = '/path/to/your/graph.csv' # graph_path is alternative
lookahead = 7 # Forward steps you would like to predict.
```

#### 3. Fit and predict

We provide a default config file in config/default.yaml. You could use your config file through config_path augment.

```python
fost = Pipeline(lookahead=lookahead, train_path=train_path, graph_path=graph_path)
fost.fit()
result = fost.predict()
```

#### 4. Plot results

```python
fost.plot(result)
```

# Data Format

> You can fetch sample data on `/examples`

### 1. train.csv

3 columns are required for `train.csv`:

+ Node: node name for current data
+ Date: date or timestamp for current data
+ TARGET: target for prediction

A valid format may look like:

| Node    | Date       | TARGET     |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Alaska  | 1960-01-01 | 800592.0   |
| Alaska  | 1961-01-01 | 933600.0   |
| Alabama | 1960-01-01 | 10141633.0 |
| Alabama | 1961-01-01 | 9885992.0  |
| Alabama | 1962-01-01 | 10497917.0 |

Columns except above will be regarded as feature columns.

### 2. graph.csv (option)

`graph.csv` should only contains 3 columns:

+ node_0: node name for first node, node name should align with node name in `train.csv`.
+ node_1: node name for second node, node name should align with node name in `train.csv`.
+ weight: weight on connection for node_0 to node_1.

If `graph.csv` is not provided, identity graph will be used.

# Examples
We prepared several examples on `examples`:

1. [Predict simulation cosine curve](/examples/1.%20Cosine%20prediction.ipynb)
2. [Predict States Energy Data](/examples/2.%20Predict%20States%20Energy%20Data.ipynb)
3. [Save and load model](/examples/3.%20Save%20and%20load.ipynb)
